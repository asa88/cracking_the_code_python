'''
You are given a 1D array of integers, such as: 
int[] array = [3,4,7,2,2,6,0,9]; 
Suppose you need to treat this array as a 2D table with a given number of rows. 
You want to sum the columns of the table. 
One value of numRows is 4..in that case the resultant array would look like
what if numRows==4? 
3 4 
7 2 
2 6 
0 9 
â€”- 
12 21
